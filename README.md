# RRT_Simulation
Simulation of the RRT Path Finding algorithm in python.

![Image of the Path](/images/RRT_algo.png)
This image shows a sample working of the algorithm.
This program simulates the popular Rapidly Exploring Random Tree(RRT) ptah finding algorithm in python.
Some obstacles are generated randomly on the map and this algorithm finds the path from the start node to the goal node avoiding these obstacles.
The basic principle for this algorithm is to generate random nodes on the map, connect them and find the path to the goal node.
